    <h3>About Ethiopia</h3>
    <p>
Ethiopia is a country in North Eastern Africa. <br>It is known as "the land of origins" because of its important archaeological and paleontological discoveries. <br>The earliest human ancestors were found in the Afar Depression in northeastern Ethiopia.<br>
Ethiopia is the oldest independent country in Africa and one of the oldest in the world.<br>
 What are believed to be the oldest remains of a human ancestor ever found,<br>
 which have been dated as being some five million years old, <br>
 were discovered in the Awash Valley in Ethiopia.<br>
  This beats the discovery of “Lucy”, a 3.2 million year old skeleton, <br>
  who was unearthed in the same area in 1974.
